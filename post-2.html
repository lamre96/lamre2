<p><strong>What is acne?<br></strong>Acne is one of the most annoying and common skin problems in the world. Although acne is generally associated with teens and puberty, the fact is that you can get pimples at any age. Acne can develop on various parts of the body, including the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and arms. Although most people think of acne as the classic youth pimples, acne can take different forms. What can you do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Overproduction of sebum<br></strong>Pimples are the result of various factors in the skin. When the bacterium ‘propionibacterium acnes’ (also known as cutibacterium) multiplies rapidly, inflammation can develop. This bacteria “feeds” on sebum, which makes the inflammation worse and sebum builds up in the pore. The buildup of dead skin cells on the skin’s surface and in the pore prevents the sebum from being released freely from the skin, clogging the pores and leading to inflammation leading to breakouts.<ins></ins></p>

<p>It is essential that your skin care products do not contain any irritants, such as camphor or alcohol. They are incredibly common in sebum-absorbing pimple-absorbing products. These make the problem worse or cause dry, flaky, red skin. If these steps aren’t enough after at least four weeks of consistent use, you can see a doctor to discuss medical treatment for pimples. Options include a topical retinoid (vitamin A) or antibiotic with benzoyl peroxide.</p>
